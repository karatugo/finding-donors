    "performance would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not*\n",
    "make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*,\n",
    "since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Forest\n",
    "  * One can use Random Forest algorithm to recommend applications to users of\n",
    "  AppStore.\n",
    "  * Random Forest avoids Decision Tree algorithms overfit to the training data. Also,\n",
    "  they are flexible and one can easily determine the important features.\n",
    "  See [[1]](#1), [[3]](#3) for more details.\n",
    "  * Random Forest algorithm's accuracy is usually worse than gradient boosted trees.\n",
    "  Furthermore, they are more complex compared to decision tree and hence more\n",
    "  time and resource consuming. See [[2]](#2), [[3]](#3) for more details.\n",
    "  * It looks like a good choice as it is flexible and beginner friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AdaBoost\n",
    "  * One can use AdaBoost to predict customer churn.\n",
    "  * AdaBoost can combine multiple weak learners and hence create a strong learner.\n",
    "  Moreover, it is usually seen as \"the best out-of-the-box classifier\". [[6]](#6)\n",
    "  * It needs a high quality dataset. [[4]](#4)\n",
    "  * There are less hyperparameters in AdaBoost. So, it is easy to use yet strong\n",
    "  algorithm. See [[4]](#4), [[5]](#5).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SVM\n",
    "  * Hand-written characters can be recognized using SVM. [[7]](#7)\n",
    "  * SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces and memory-efficient. [[8]](#8)\n",
    "  * SVM algorithm is not suitable for large data sets. Furthermore, choosing an good\n",
    "  kernel for SVM is not easy. [[8]](#8), [[9]](#9)\n",
    "  * Our dataset is relatively small, so I think SVM will work well in our case.\n",
